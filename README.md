# Twitter Graph Analysis
This project analyzes a graph of Twitter users and their followers, with the goal of understanding the structure of the social network and the interactions between users. The graph is represented as a set of edges between Twitter user IDs, and the analysis includes computing various graph statistics such as the number of vertices and edges, the connected components of the graph, and the average distance between pairs of vertices.
